Participants will write a program\n    in Python that must read the input data via stdin and output the result via stdout.\n  - The participants usually need to come up with a clever combination of one or more classical\n    algorithms in order to solve the problem.\n  - The problem must allow a range of solutions using various algorithmic techniques, with different\n    algorithmic complexities (e.g. a brute force solution might be O(n^3) while a smart use of dynamic programming\n    could allow a linear solution, or the like).\n  - The optimal solution to the problem could be found, implemented and tested by an olympiad participant (who\n    is experienced in competitive programming) within about 30-60 minutes.\n  - The problem must be accompanied by a number of tests, where each test consists of a text file with problem input data\n    and a text file with correct output.\n\nYou are trying to develop a new olympiad problem. Please, proceed step by step as follows:\n\n# Step 1.\n\nList the most common algorithms or algorithmic techniques that are usually involved in informatics olympiad problems.\n\n# Step 2.\n\nUsing the list of algorithms produced in Step 1, come up with five potential problems which require a combination of two or three\nalgorithmics techniques listed in Step 1 to be solved.\n\n# Step 3.\n\nFor each of the problems you produced in Step 2, verify that it indeed requires a clever combination of algorithmic techniques to be solved\nand that it can be solved using a range of approaches with different solutions having different algorithmic complexities.\nRemove problems that do not fit these criteria.\n\n# Step 4.\n\nWrite the optimal solution for each of the problems remaining after Step 3 in Python.\nLeave only those who can be solved in at most 100 lines of code.\n\n# Step 5.\n\nCome up with a potential storyline for each of the problems remaining after step 4. Assess the interestingness of the storyline\non a scale from 1 (boring) to 5 (exciting).\n\nLeave only the problems that scored at least 4.\n\n# Step 6.\n\nFinally, pick one of the problems from step 5 and:\n\n  - List what are the possible algorithmic solutions with possible algorithmic complexities.\n    For each such algorithmic complexity, create a test case (i.e. a pair of input and output files)\n    that could be solved using a Python solution with such algorithmic complexity within 0.1 seconds, \n    but would not be solvable by code that has worse complexity.\n\n  - List all the tricky corner cases the problem may have and for each corner case create a test case that would fail\n    unless the solution code takes that corner case into account.\n\n# Step 7.\n\nOutput the produced problem in the following format:\n\n<problem>\n<statement>\n.. problem statement in Markdown format ...\n</statement>\n<solutions>\n  <solution complexity=\"linear/quadratic/...\">\n    ... solution in Python ...\n  </solution>\n  <solution ...>\n    ... solutions for other complexities ...\n  </solution>\n</solutions>\n<tests>\n  <test comment=\"..explanation of the test case\">\n    <input>\n      .. input text data ...\n    </input>\n    <output>\n    .. expected output text data...\n    </output>\n  </test>\n  ... other tests as required\n</tests>\n"

The sea is dotted with **N** cities in total, connected by **M** bidirectional sea routes. Each route connects two cities and has a specific travel time associated with it.\n\nAmong the N cities, some are renowned for their lucrative **markets**. You have identified a list of these market cities. Your goal is to embark on a trading expedition starting from your home port S, visiting **at least K** different market cities to trade goods, and finally returning to S. You can visit cities (including S and market cities) multiple times if it helps shorten your route.\n\nYour task is to find a route that fulfills these conditions while minimizing the total travel time for the entire journey.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe first line contains two integers **N** and **M** (2 ≤ N ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ M ≤ 5000), the number of cities and the number of sea routes. Cities are numbered from 1 to N.\n\nThe next M lines each contain three integers **u**, **v**, and **t** (1 ≤ u, v ≤ N, u ≠ v, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), representing a bidirectional sea route between city u and city v with a travel time of t.\n\nThe following line contains two integers **S** and **K** (1 ≤ S ≤ N, 0 ≤ K ≤ 20), your starting city and the minimum number of distinct market cities you need to visit.\n\nThe last line contains a list of distinct integers representing the market cities. The number of market cities listed will be between max(1, K) and N if K > 0. If K = 0, this line may be empty or contain market cities. Let this list be `Markets`. S may or may not be in the list `Markets`. If S is in `Markets` and you visit it (which you do, as you start and end there), it counts towards the K required market visits.\n\n**Output**\n\nOutput a single integer representing the minimum total travel time required for the journey. If it's impossible to start at S, visit at least K distinct market cities, and return to S, output \"IMPOSSIBLE\".\n\n**Constraints**\n\n*   2 ≤ N ≤ 1000\n*   1 ≤ M ≤ 5000\n*   1 ≤ u, v ≤ N, u ≠ v\n*   1 ≤ t ≤ 1000\n*   1 ≤ S ≤ N\n*   0 ≤ K ≤ 20\n*   If K > 0, the number of market cities listed is between K and N (inclusive).\n*   If K = 0, the number of market cities listed is between 0 and N (inclusive).\n*   All market cities listed are distinct and between 1 and N.\n*   The graph is not guaranteed to be connected.\n\n**Example 1**\n\n*Input:*\n```\n4 4\n1 2 10\n2 3 5\n3 4 8\n1 4 25\n1 2\n2 4\n```\n*Output:*\n```\n46\n```\n*Explanation:*\nStart at S=1, need to visit K=2 markets {2, 4}.\nOne optimal route: 1 -> 2 (cost 10, Market 1) -> 3 (cost 5) -> 4 (cost 8, Market 2) -> 3 (cost 8) -> 2 (cost 5) -> 1 (cost 10).\nTotal time = 10 + 5 + 8 + 8 + 5 + 10 = 46.\n\n**Example 2**\n\n*Input:*\n```\n5 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 10\n4 5 10\n1 2\n3 4\n```\n*Output:*\n```\nIMPOSSIBLE\n```\n*Explanation:*\nStart at S=1, need K=2 markets {3, 4}. Market 3 is reachable (1->2->3). Market 4 is in a separate component. It's impossible to visit both.\n\n**Example 3**\n\n*Input:*\n```\n3 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 5\n1 3 20\n1 0\n2 3\n```\n*Output:*\n```\n0\n```\n*Explanation:*\nStart at S=1, need K=0 markets. The shortest path is to start at S and immediately return, taking 0 time.\n\n**Example 4**\n\n*Input:*\n```\n3 3\n1 2 10\n2 3 5\n1 3 20\n1 0\n\n```\n*Output:*\n```\n0\n```\n*Explanation:*\nStart at S=1, need K=0 markets.
