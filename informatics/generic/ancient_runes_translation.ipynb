Participants will write a program\n    in Python that must read the input data via stdin and output the result via stdout.\n  - The participants usually need to come up with a clever combination of one or more classical\n    algorithms in order to solve the problem.\n  - The problem must allow a range of solutions using various algorithmic techniques, with different\n    algorithmic complexities (e.g. a brute force solution might be O(n^3) while a smart use of dynamic programming\n    could allow a linear solution, or the like).\n  - The optimal solution to the problem could be found, implemented and tested by an olympiad participant (who\n    is experienced in competitive programming) within about 30-60 minutes.\n  - The problem must be accompanied by a number of tests, where each test consists of a text file with problem input data\n    and a text file with correct output.\n\nYou are trying to develop a new olympiad problem. Please, proceed step by step as follows:\n\n# Step 1.\n\nList the most common algorithms or algorithmic techniques that are usually involved in informatics olympiad problems.\n\n# Step 2.\n\nUsing the list of algorithms produced in Step 1, come up with five potential problems which require a combination of two or three\nalgorithmics techniques listed in Step 1 to be solved.\n\n# Step 3.\n\nFor each of the problems you produced in Step 2, verify that it indeed requires a clever combination of algorithmic techniques to be solved\nand that it can be solved using a range of approaches with different solutions having different algorithmic complexities.\nRemove problems that do not fit these criteria.\n\n# Step 4.\n\nWrite the optimal solution for each of the problems remaining after Step 3 in Python.\nLeave only those who can be solved in at most 100 lines of code.\n\n# Step 5.\n\nCome up with a potential storyline for each of the problems remaining after step 4. Assess the interestingness of the storyline\non a scale from 1 (boring) to 5 (exciting).\n\nLeave only the problems that scored at least 4.\n\n# Step 6.\n\nFinally, pick one of the problems from step 5 and:\n\n  - List what are the possible algorithmic solutions with possible algorithmic complexities.\n    For each such algorithmic complexity, create a test case (i.e. a pair of input and output files)\n    that could be solved using a Python solution with such algorithmic complexity within 0.1 seconds,\n    but would not be solvable by code that has worse complexity.\n\n  - List all the tricky corner cases the problem may have and for each corner case create a test case that would fail\n    unless the solution code takes that corner case into account.\n\n# Step 7.\n\nOutput the produced problem in the following format:\n\n<problem>\n<statement>\n.. problem statement in Markdown format ...\n</statement>\n<solutions>\n  <solution complexity=\"linear/quadratic/...\">\n    ... solution in Python ...\n  </solution>\n  <solution ...>\n    ... solutions for other complexities ...\n  </solution>\n</solutions>\n<tests>\n  <test comment=\"..explanation of the test case\">\n    <input>\n      .. input text data ...\n    </input>\n    <output>\n    .. expected output text data...\n    </output>\n  </test>\n  ... other tests as required\n</tests>\n"

The total length constraint limits the sum, ensuring the total time for subsequence checks across all pairs is manageable if done efficiently. Total subsequence check time is bounded by Sum(len(s_i)) * M or Sum(len(w_j)) * N, roughly `10^6 * 1000 = 10^9` in worst case if not careful. A better bound is Sum over all pairs (i,j) of O(len(s_i)). Total time for building graph edges: Sum_{i=1..N} Sum_{j=1..M} O(len(s_i)) = Sum_{i=1..N} ( O(len(s_i)) * M ) = O(M * TotalLen(S)). Similarly O(N * TotalLen(W)). So graph building is roughly O(min(M*TotalLen(S), N*TotalLen(W))), which is feasible around `1000 * 10^6 = 10^9`. This is still too high. Let's re-evaluate. The subsequence check is O(len(text)). So building the graph takes Sum_{i=1..N} Sum_{j=1..M} O(len(s_i)). This is O(M * Sum(len(s_i))). Okay, this is feasible: `1000 * 1,000,000 = 10^9`.

            "text/markdown": "# Ancient Runes Translation\n\nArchaeologists excavating a historical site near the Baltic Sea have made a fascinating discovery: `N` ancient rune stones, each inscribed with a sequence of symbols. Alongside these stones, they found fragments of a dictionary containing `M` known words believed to belong to the same ancient language.\n\nThe archaeologists hypothesize that some rune inscriptions might contain these dictionary words as **subsequences**. A word `w` is a subsequence of a text `s` if `w` can be obtained from `s` by deleting zero or more symbols from `s` without changing the order of the remaining symbols. For example, \"ACE\" is a subsequence of \"ABCDE\".\n\nTo test their hypothesis, they want to find the maximum number of unique pairs `(rune_stone, dictionary_word)` they can form, such that the dictionary word is a subsequence of the symbols on the rune stone. There are two important constraints:\n1. Each rune stone can be part of at most one pair.\n2. Each dictionary word can be part of at most one pair.\n\nYour task is to help the archaeologists by calculating this maximum possible number of pairs.\n\n**Input**\n\nThe first line contains an integer `N` (0 <= N <= 1000), the number of rune stones.\nThe next `N` lines each contain a string `s_i`, representing the sequence of symbols on the i-th rune stone (1-based index).\nThe following line contains an integer `M` (0 <= M <= 1000), the number of dictionary words.\nThe next `M` lines each contain a string `w_j`, representing the j-th dictionary word (1-based index).\n\nThe strings consist of uppercase English letters ('A'-'Z'). The length of each string `s_i` and `w_j` is between 0 and 1000, inclusive.\n\n**Output**\n\nOutput a single integer representing the maximum number of pairs `(rune_stone, dictionary_word)` that can be formed according to the rules.\n\n**Constraints**\n\n*   0 <= N <= 1000\n*   0 <= M <= 1000\n*   0 <= length(`s_i`), length(`w_j`) <= 1000\n*   The total number of symbols across all `s_i` is at most 1,000,000.\n*   The total number of symbols across all `w_j` is at most 1,000,000.\n*   *Note:* The constraints imply that the `O(N*M*L)` part for subsequence checking might be up to `N * M * avg_L`, which could be around `1000 * 1000 * 1 = 10^6` if lengths are small on average, or higher if lengths are concentrated. The total length constraint limits the sum, ensuring the total time for subsequence checks across all pairs is manageable if done efficiently. Total subsequence check time is bounded by Sum(len(s_i)) * M or Sum(len(w_j)) * N, roughly `10^6 * 1000 = 10^9` in worst case if not careful. A better bound is Sum over all pairs (i,j) of O(len(s_i)). Total time for building graph edges: Sum_{i=1..N} Sum_{j=1..M} O(len(s_i)) = Sum_{i=1..N} ( O(len(s_i)) * M ) = O(M * TotalLen(S)). Similarly O(N * TotalLen(W)). So graph building is roughly O(min(M*TotalLen(S), N*TotalLen(W))), which is feasible around `1000 * 10^6 = 10^9`. This is still too high. Let's re-evaluate. The subsequence check is O(len(text)). So building the graph takes Sum_{i=1..N} Sum_{j=1..M} O(len(s_i)). This is O(M * Sum(len(s_i))). Okay, this is feasible: `1000 * 1,000,000 = 10^9`. Still too high for 1 second!\n\n*   *Revised Constraints:* Let's adjust constraints for feasibility.\n    *   `N, M <= 500`. Total length `s_i <= 500,000`. Total length `w_j <= 500,000`.\n    *   Graph building: `M * TotalLen(S)` -> `500 * 500,000 = 2.5 * 10^8`. Borderline for Python, OK for C++.\n    *   Matching: `V=1000`, `E <= 500*500 = 2.5*10^5`. `O(E*sqrt(V))` -> `2.5e5 * sqrt(1000) approx 2.5e5 * 31.6 = 7.9 * 10^6`. Fast. `O(E*V)` -> `2.5e5 * 1000 = 2.5 * 10^8`. Borderline/Slow.\n    *   Let's use these revised constraints.\n\n*   **Revised Constraints Section:**\n    *   0 <= N <= 500\n    *   0 <= M <= 500\n    *   0 <= length(`s_i`), length(`w_j`) <= 1000 (Individual length limit still useful)\n    *   The total number of symbols across all `s_i` (Sum(len(s_i))) is at most 500,000.\n    *   The total number of symbols across all `w_j` (Sum(len(w_j))) is at most 500,000.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nInput:\n```\n3\nABCDE\nAXBCY\nAZERTY\n3\nACE\nAY\nXYZ\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n2\n```\n\n**Explanation 1**\nWe can form two pairs:\n1. Rune stone \"ABCDE\" and dictionary word \"ACE\" (\"ACE\" is a subsequence of \"ABCDE\").\n2. Rune stone \"AXBCY\" and dictionary word \"AY\" (\"AY\" is a subsequence of \"AXBCY\").\nThe third rune stone \"AZERTY\" does not contain \"XYZ\" as a subsequence. We cannot use \"ACE\" or \"AY\" again. Maximum is 2 pairs.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nInput:\n```\n2\nHELLO\nHELLO\n1\nLO\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n1\n```\n\n**Explanation 2**\nThe word \"LO\" is a subsequence of both \"HELLO\" rune stones. However, the word \"LO\" can only be used in one pair. We can pair (\"HELLO\" stone 1, \"LO\") or (\"HELLO\" stone 2, \"LO\"). The maximum is 1.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nInput:\n```\n1\n\n1\nABC\n```\n*(Note: First rune stone is empty string)*\n\nOutput:\n```\n0\n```\n**Explanation 3**\nThe non-empty word \"ABC\" cannot be a subsequence of the empty rune stone inscription.\n\n**Example 4**\n\nInput:\n```\n2\nABC\n\n2\n\nA\n```\n*(Note: Second rune stone and first word are empty strings)*\n\nOutput:\n```\n1\n```\n**Explanation 4**\nThe empty word \"\" is a subsequence of \"ABC\". Alternatively, the empty word \"\" is a subsequence of the empty rune stone \"\". We want to maximize pairs. We can pair (rune \"ABC\", word \"\") or (rune \"\", word \"\"). Max pairs = 1. (Or pair (rune \"ABC\", word \"A\")). Max is 1. Let's take (rune \"ABC\", word \"A\")."
