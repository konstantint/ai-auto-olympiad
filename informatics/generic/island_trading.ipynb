Participants will write a program\n    in Python that must read the input data via stdin and output the result via stdout.\n  - The participants usually need to come up with a clever combination of one or more classical\n    algorithms in order to solve the problem.\n  - The problem must allow a range of solutions using various algorithmic techniques, with different\n    algorithmic complexities (e.g. a brute force solution might be O(n^3) while a smart use of dynamic programming\n    could allow a linear solution, or the like).\n  - The optimal solution to the problem could be found, implemented and tested by an olympiad participant (who\n    is experienced in competitive programming) within about 30-60 minutes.\n  - The problem must be accompanied by a number of tests, where each test consists of a text file with problem input data\n    and a text file with correct output.\n\nYou are trying to develop a new olympiad problem. Please, proceed step by step as follows:\n\n# Step 1.\n\nList the most common algorithms or algorithmic techniques that are usually involved in informatics olympiad problems.\n\n# Step 2.\n\nUsing the list of algorithms produced in Step 1, come up with five potential problems which require a combination of two or three\nalgorithmics techniques listed in Step 1 to be solved.\n\n# Step 3.\n\nFor each of the problems you produced in Step 2, verify that it indeed requires a clever combination of algorithmic techniques to be solved\nand that it can be solved using a range of approaches with different solutions having different algorithmic complexities.\nRemove problems that do not fit these criteria.\n\n# Step 4.\n\nWrite the optimal solution for each of the problems remaining after Step 3 in Python.\nLeave only those who can be solved in at most 100 lines of code.\n\n# Step 5.\n\nCome up with a potential storyline for each of the problems remaining after step 4. Assess the interestingness of the storyline\non a scale from 1 (boring) to 5 (exciting).\n\nLeave only the problems that scored at least 4.\n\n# Step 6.\n\nFinally, pick one of the problems from step 5 and:\n\n  - List what are the possible algorithmic solutions with possible algorithmic complexities.\n    For each such algorithmic complexity, create a test case (i.e. a pair of input and output files)\n    that could be solved using a Python solution with such algorithmic complexity within 0.1 seconds,\n    but would not be solvable by code that has worse complexity.\n\n  - List all the tricky corner cases the problem may have and for each corner case create a test case that would fail\n    unless the solution code takes that corner case into account.\n\n# Step 7.\n\nOutput the produced problem in the following format:\n\n<problem>\n<statement>\n.. problem statement in Markdown format ...\n</statement>\n<solutions>\n  <solution complexity=\"linear/quadratic/...\">\n    ... solution in Python ...\n  </solution>\n  <solution ...>\n    ... solutions for other complexities ...\n  </solution>\n</solutions>\n<tests>\n  <test comment=\"..explanation of the test case\">\n    <input>\n      .. input text data ...\n    </input>\n    <output>\n    .. expected output text data...\n    </output>\n  </test>\n  ... other tests as required\n</tests>\n"

            "text/markdown": "# Island Trading\n\nYou are an adventurous merchant sailing the Byteonian Sea, a region known for its N islands connected by M bidirectional sea routes. Each route between two islands takes a specific amount of time to travel.\n\nLife here revolves around trade. Each island `i` is known for producing a unique type of good, identified by an integer `G_i`. Furthermore, each island `j` has a demand for a specific good, `D_j`, and offers a profit `P_j` if this demand is met.\n\nYour journey begins at island 1. You start with no goods in your cargo hold. Your ship is small and can only carry one unit of good at a time.\n\nHere's how trading works:\n- When you are at an island `k`, if your cargo hold is empty, you can choose to pick up the good `G_k` produced there.\n- When you arrive at an island `j`, if you are carrying a good `g`, you can choose to drop it off.\n- To satisfy the demand `D_j` at island `j` and claim the profit `P_j`, you must arrive at island `j` carrying exactly the good `D_j` and then drop it off. The good `D_j` must have been picked up earlier from some island `k` where `G_k = D_j`.\n- Each island's demand can only be satisfied once.\n- Picking up or dropping off a good takes negligible time. Travel between islands takes the specified time for the route.\n\nYou have a limited amount of time, `T`, for your entire trading expedition. Your goal is to plan your voyages – deciding which goods to pick up, where to deliver them, and which routes to take – in order to maximize the total profit earned from satisfied demands within the time limit `T`.\n\n## Input Format\n\nThe first line contains five integers: `N`, `K`, `M`, `T`, `start_node`.\n- `N`: The number of islands (1 <= N <= 50).\n- `K`: The number of islands that have a demand (0 <= K <= 20).\n- `M`: The number of sea routes (0 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2).\n- `T`: The maximum time allowed (0 <= T <= 10^9).\n- `start_node`: The island where you start (always 1).\n\nThe next `N` lines describe the islands. The `i`-th line (1-based index for islands) contains three integers: `G_i`, `D_i`, `P_i`.\n- `G_i`: The good produced at island `i` (1 <= `G_i` <= 100, or -1 if no good is produced).\n- `D_i`: The good demanded at island `i` (1 <= `D_i` <= 100, or -1 if no good is demanded). If `D_i != -1`, this island is one of the `K` islands with demand.\n- `P_i`: The profit earned for satisfying the demand at island `i` (0 <= `P_i` <= 10^6). If `D_i == -1`, then `P_i` will be 0.\n\nThe next `M` lines describe the sea routes. Each line contains three integers: `u`, `v`, `time`.\n- `u`, `v`: The two islands connected by the route (1 <= u, v <= N, u != v).\n- `time`: The time taken to travel between `u` and `v` (1 <= `time` <= 10^7).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the number of islands `i` with `D_i != -1` is exactly `K`. It is possible that `G_i = D_i`. It is possible that multiple islands produce the same good. The graph of islands and routes may not be connected.\n\n## Output Format\n\nOutput a single integer: the maximum total profit you can achieve within the time limit `T`.\n\n## Constraints\n\n- 1 <= N <= 50\n- 0 <= K <= 20\n- 0 <= M <= N*(N-1)/2\n- 0 <= T <= 10^9\n- `start_node` = 1\n- 1 <= `G_i`, `D_i` <= 100 (or -1)\n- 0 <= `P_i` <= 10^6\n- 1 <= u, v <= N\n- 1 <= `time` <= 10^7\n\n## Example\n\n**Input:**\n```\n5 3 5 50 1\n10 -1 0\n20 30 100\n30 40 150\n40 20 80\n50 -1 0\n1 2 10\n1 3 12\n2 4 8\n3 4 7\n3 5 15\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n330\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe islands with demands are 2 (wants 30, profit 100), 3 (wants 40, profit 150), and 4 (wants 20, profit 80).\nIsland 1 produces 10. Island 2 produces 20. Island 3 produces 30. Island 4 produces 40. Island 5 produces 50.\n\nOne possible sequence to achieve profit 330 within time 50:\n1. Start at Island 1. Travel 1 -> 3 (Time: 12). Pick up Good 30. Total Time: 12.\n2. Travel 3 -> 4 -> 2 (Time: 7 + 8 = 15). Deliver Good 30 at Island 2. Total Time: 12 + 15 = 27. Profit: 100. Current Location: Island 2.\n3. Pick up Good 20 at Island 2. Travel 2 -> 4 (Time: 8). Deliver Good 20 at Island 4. Total Time: 27 + 8 = 35. Profit: 100 + 80 = 180. Current Location: Island 4.\n4. Pick up Good 40 at Island 4. Travel 4 -> 3 (Time: 7). Deliver Good 40 at Island 3. Total Time: 35 + 7 = 42. Profit: 180 + 150 = 330. Current Location: Island 3.\n\nTotal time is 42, which is <= 50. Total profit is 330. This is the maximum possible profit."

Since N is small (<= 50), we can use either the Floyd-Warshall algorithm (O(N^3)) or run Dijkstra's algorithm from each island (O(N * (M + N log N))). Dijkstra is generally faster for sparse graphs, but N^3 is acceptable here. Let `dist[u][v]` be the shortest time from island `u` to `v`.\n",

Precompute Task Times: A \"task\" consists of starting at an island `u`, traveling to a producer island `k` for a specific good `g`, picking it up, traveling to a demand island `j` that demands good `g`, and dropping it off. The time for this task, starting from `u` to satisfy demand at `j` (which requires good `D_j`), is `min_{k | G_k = D_j} (dist[u][k] + dist[k][j])`. We need to precompute these minimum task times. Let `task_time[u][demand_idx]` be the minimum time to start at island `u` and complete the task for the demand island identified by `demand_idx`. The relevant starting islands `u` are the initial `start_node` and all demand islands (since we end up at a demand island after completing a task).\n",

The time for this new task starting from `demand_islands[last_idx][0]` is `task_time[demand_islands[last_idx][0]][next_idx]`. The total time would be `new_time = dp[mask][last_idx] + task_time[demand_islands[last_idx][0]][next_idx]`.

If `min_time_for_mask <= T` (or simply check if any `dp[mask][last_idx]` is finite), calculate the total profit for this mask (sum of `P_j` for all `j` in the mask).
